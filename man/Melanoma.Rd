\description{
In the period 1962-77, 205 patients with malignant melanoma (cancer of the
skin) had a radical operation performed at Odense University Hospital,
Denmark. All patients were followed until the end of 1977 by which time 134
were still alive while 71 had died (of out whom 57 had died from cancer and
14 from other causes).
}
\details{
The object of the study was to assess the effect of risk factors on
survival. Among such risk factors were the sex and age of the patients and
the histological variables tumor thickness and ulceration (absent vs.
present).
